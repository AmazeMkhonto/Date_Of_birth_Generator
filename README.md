# Date_of_birth_generator

The program reads a file of ID numbers, extracts the birth date, validates the ID number, and counts the number of people born before and after 2010. The birth date is stored as a DateTime object and written to the console. The program also writes the number of people born before and after 2010 to a text file named ageCount.txt.
